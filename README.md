# myCpp
Package containing my Rcpp functions for use in snowfall

## Motivation
C++ functions are hard to include in parallel processes within R
unless stored in a package that can be uploaded to a cluster. The sole 
purpose of this package is to house some of my C++ functions so I can
use them with `snowfall`.
